# Product Service

This is a backend microservice which provides services to interact with 'orders'.

This is merely a very simple "entity-driven" microservice as it is just purely a CRUD wrapper.

Currently, this microservice allows users to:
- Create new items
- Fetch list of all items

This microservice connects to a NoSQL Key/Value [Redis](https://redis.io/) datastore.

## Technologies

- Java 8
- Spring:
    - Spring Boot
    - Spring Data Redis
    - Spring Security
      - JWT
- Redis
- Swagger
- Maven
- Docker:
    - Docker Compose
- RestAssured
- TestContainers

    
## Local Mode

Run directly from your IDE or from CLI using following command:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

for the backed Redis datastore, launch a docker container for it (via Docker-Compose):

```bash
docker-compose up -d product-service-db-redis
```

## Development Mode

You can run this microservice in "Development mode" which is a mode that allows firing up the Order Service tech stack. This mode can be used for simple demo with the team or for functional testing by QAs/Testers.

This sub project is docker-composed to achieve this:

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

#

### Building

First require to build a jar artifact:

```bash
./mvnw clean install
```

Then construct the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t order-service .
```

## API Documentation

You can access the documentation for the API using Swagger:

```bash
http://{order-service-url}:8082/swagger-ui.html
```

## Functional Testing (using Postman)

For doing functional testing of this microservice you can use a http client. I like to use Postman.

All of the API endpoints of this microservice are authenticated and thus require the user to be authorized to execute them. See Authenticated section below.


## Authentication

As this whole project uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication, it is required to get a valid JWT token first from the __User-Service__.

User-Service maintains a list of valid users of the Sales Order System application so it is required to have a valid user to use for it to return a valid JWT token. If required, sign up a new user. Please see __User Service__ for more details on this setup.

Once obtained a valid JWT token, first make a request to:

```bash
http://{user-service-url}:8080/authenticate
```

with the following body in request:

```json
{
    "username": [a valid username here],
    "password": [a valid password here]
}
```

Http Client Postman handles most header defaults for you but if using other mechanism such as Curl then must ensure:

- Content-Type of 'application/json' is set
